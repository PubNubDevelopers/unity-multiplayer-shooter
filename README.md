# PubNub Unity Game Demo

The Super Multiplayer Shooter Unity template game enhanced with PubNub functionality.
Open the project using the Unity Hub.

If you are receiving "Multiple precompiled assemblies errors with Photon" errors when first loading the game in Unity, delete the Photon3Unity3D.dll in Assets > Photon > Photon Libs > Metro and in Assets > Photon > Photon Libs >netstandard. The errors should go away.
